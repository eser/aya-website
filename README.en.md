(For Turkish please click [here](README.md))

We are a close-knit and passionate community of individuals who share a common interest in open source software and open
source data. United by our dedication to leveraging technology for the betterment of society, we joined forces following
the devastating [February 2023 earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquake) in
Turkey.

In the aftermath of the earthquake, we recognized the pressing need to support those affected and assist in the process
of reuniting families and loved ones. With this purpose in mind, we set out to develop innovative tools and solutions
aimed at facilitating the search and connection between individuals.

Through tireless collaboration and a collective effort, our community has grown to an inspiring size of 24,000
individuals. Together, we continue to refine and expand our tools, harnessing the power of technology to help reunite
families, restore hope, and bring solace to those impacted by the earthquake.

As we forge ahead, our commitment remains unwavering. We strive to enhance our tools, actively contribute to open source
projects, and foster a supportive environment where knowledge sharing and collaboration thrive. We are proud to be a
part of the open source community and look forward to continuing our journey with you.

## Our Mission

We are actively engaged in utilizing open-source solutions, applying information systems, and implementing engineering
practices to contribute to the betterment of the society we reside in. Our primary focus lies in fulfilling social
